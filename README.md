This project made by me as a practice new technologies I learned.

on Front-End;
Screens drawed by using Adobe XD,
Tailwind CSS chosen for fast and clean constructor for my components,
React.js and for state management I did use Redux Toolkit.
Next.js included for easy paging and bundle operations.(and also its cool!)
And lastly Yup for Object schema validation.

on Back-End;
Django and REST API duo was best option I could go!
